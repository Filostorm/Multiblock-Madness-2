--- Terralith Config File Description ---

terrablender-compatibility: true by default
   This option determines whether Terralith should create a Terrablender region.
   Enabling will allow for better biome rarity and compatibility with other mods.
   Disabling will allow Terralith to function as it would a datapack.
   Note: If compatibility is disabled, but BYG or BoP are installed, compatibility will be forced.

cursed-skylands: "none" by default
   This option determines whether Skylands will be cursed - ONLY takes effect when Terrablender compatibility is enabled!
   The options consist of "none", "some", and "very". DO NOT use "some" or "very" in a real world, unless you know what you're doing!
   None - Skylands generate as normally as they can
   Some - Skylands can generate on top of each other, be very large, and sometimes "cancel" out ocean-based biomes such as Mirage Isles.
   Very - Skylands can generate anywhere and everywhere. This includes on each other, above land, and *in* land!
   It should be noted that if Terrablender compatibility is disabled, the cursed generation will not occur, no matter what.
      *Cursed option provided in loving memory of catter's pain and suffering*
